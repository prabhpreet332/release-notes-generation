# release-notes-generation

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to have the release notes generated from the Version Control Softwares like Git, Github, Gitlab. There is a attempt to create a single tool to deal with multiple input sources (GitHub, GitLab, Git-Local) and output to multiple targets (stdout, confluence, word document etc) with different formats (markdown, plain text).


### Motivation
Motivation for working on this project has been primarily to have the single tool for release note generation. Many devs have probably built this kind of tool for their employers. Some might even have developed it more than once for different organizations that they have worked in. Hence the motivation to do it once and integrate it wherever possible. Also, I wanted to improve on design skills. 

### Why starting this during hacktoberfest event?

I recently joined a new organization and had to deal with the end-of-quarter deployments, which required me to create release notes. Hence, thought of working on this.

Many developers would be active, and the project is pretty simple. I personally have a few junior teammates, whom I am assigned as a mentor, that might find this as a learning opportunity.
